# .dotfiles :memo:

Yet another attempt to group boilerplate in one place to speed up new development environments

## Description

In an attempt to gain control and preserve my configuration and set up. I jumped into the wave to explore the benefits of the `dotfiles`

> Dealing with these files can be initially a journey full of clashes and frustrations in the way, but I can only remark how beneficial it is mastering and growing the content of this repository resulted.

## Migration

Make sure you have your alias configured

```
alias dotfiles='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles/ --work-tree=$HOME'
```

Consider ignoring the container folder
```
echo ".dotfiles" >> .gitignore
```

Install config tracking in your $HOME by running:

```
curl -Lks https://github.com/threenary/.dotfiles/raw/master/.bin/dotfiles_install.sh | /bin/bash
```


## Content

### `/.bin`

File        |  Intention
------------ | -------------
[`dottfiles_init.sh`](https://github.com/threenary/.dotfiles/blob/master/.bin/dotfiles_init.sh) | Starting point that will help you create a bare repository from which start tracking your files
[`dotfiles_install.sh`](https://github.com/threenary/.dotfiles/blob/master/.bin/dotfiles_install.sh) | Assuming you have already been tracking dotfiles, this will install them in a new machine cloning the bare repository in your $HOME
[`osx_install.sh`](https://github.com/threenary/.dotfiles/blob/master/.bin/osx_install.sh) | Fresh install for a MacOS
[`Brewfile`](https://github.com/threenary/.dotfiles/blob/master/.bin/Brewfile) |Â Bundler to install packages, casks and Macstore apps
[`os_init.sh`](https://github.com/threenary/.dotfiles/blob/master/.bin/os_init.sh) | Missing bits that should work independently from the OS

Within this folder I encourage to contain different scripts that are handy for your day to day work. They can be contained in dedicated subfolders.


### `./aliases`

Include here the usefull aliases you might want to reference in order to be more agile.
I encourage to groupd them within domain related file. The content of this folders is intended to be downloaded to your machine within the `.dotfiles` bare repository, which later will be sourced within the `.zshrc`


## Disclaimer

:warning: It is very important that if you chose to use the files, please review the content first
